Developed and implemented a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins to automate the deployment of a static website hosted on GitHub Pages.​

Key Responsibilities:

    Pipeline Development: Configured Jenkins to monitor the GitHub repository for code changes, triggering automated build and deployment processes upon each commit.​

    Automation Scripting: Utilized shell scripts within Jenkins jobs to automate tasks such as code fetching, build processes, and deployment to the hosting environment.​

    Integration with Version Control: Established seamless integration between Jenkins and GitHub, ensuring efficient code updates and version control management.​

    Error Handling and Notifications: Implemented error detection mechanisms and configured notifications to promptly inform the team of build or deployment issues.​

Technologies Used:

    CI/CD Tools: Jenkins​

    Version Control: Git, GitHub​

    Scripting Languages: Shell scripting​

Achievements:

    Reduced Deployment Time: Automated the deployment process, reducing manual intervention and deployment time by 50%
